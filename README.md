Fitator
=======

* status: 0.9.5 (beta)

A small tool (with a not so creative name) to convert [fitocracy](https://www.fitocracy.com) points into a 'currency' I can use to do things (as some kind of treat e.g. watching TV or gaming).
I am not affiliated with Fitocracy whatsoever!
They will not support or improve anything related to this code.
I just use their color and logo so it feels more real for me.
But it still is their logo and design!

The neat icons (Stopwatch, Scissors and Deadlift) were designed by Scott Lewis (http://thenounproject.com/iconify) and are available in high resolution.
Thanks for sharing, Scott!
